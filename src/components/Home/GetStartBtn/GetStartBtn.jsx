                    <p className='my-5'>Web design refers to the design of websites. It usually refers to the <a className="link link-info" href="#"> user experience</a> aspects of website development rather than software development. Web design used to be focused on designing websites for desktop browsers; however, since the mid-2010s, design for mobile and tablet browsers has become ever-increasingly important. A web designer works on a website's appearance, layout, and, in some cases, content.</p>

                        <li><i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right mr-3"></i> <strong>Appearance</strong> relates to the colors,<a className="link link-info" href="#"> typography,</a> and images used.</li>

                        <li><i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right mr-3"></i> <strong>Layout refers</strong> to how information is structured and categorized. A good web design is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and suits the user group and brand of the website.</li>

                        <li><i className="fa-solid fa-arrow-right mr-3"></i> A well-designed website is simple and <strong>communicates</strong> clearly to avoid confusing users. It wins and fosters the target audience's trust, removing as many potential points of <a className="link link-info" href="#">user frustration </a> as possible.</li>

                        <p>Responsive and <a className="link link-info" href="#"> adaptive design </a>are two common ways to design websites that work well on both desktop and mobile.</p>

Since different layouts and are created for different devices their User Experience might differ too. A different User Experience can be created for multiple devices.</h3>
